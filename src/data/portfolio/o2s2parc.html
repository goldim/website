            <p>Description from <a href="https://docs.osparc.io/"
                                   rel="nofollow">the docs</a>: The
              aim of o2S2PARC is to establish a comprehensive, freely
              accessible, intuitive, and interactive online platform
              for simulating peripheral nerve system
              neuromodulation/stimulation and its impact on organ
              physiology in a precise and predictive manner. To
              achieve this, the platform will comprise both
              state-of-the art and highly detailed animal and human
              anatomical models with realistic tissue property
              distributions that make it possible to perform
              simulations ranging from the molecular scale up to the
              complexity of the human body.</p>
