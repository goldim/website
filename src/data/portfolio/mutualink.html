              provides an incident-based highly intuitive graphical user
              interface (GUI) used by a dispatcher or incident manager to
              communicate with other dispatch personnel and units in the
              field. Easily share radio, voice, video &amp; data for
              cross-agency collaboration. Connect with partner agencies in
              real time with Mutualink’s interoperability system to
              quickly resolve incidents.</p>
            <p>Public safety agencies and critical infrastructure
              organizations need radio interoperability. Our solution goes
              beyond basic radio interoperability to provide LMR to LMR,
              LMR to LTE, real-time video sharing, geospatial information
              and data sharing capabilities.</p>
            <p>All of this is possible through our powerful capability and
              network called the Interoperable Response and Preparedness
              Platform (IRAPP). This network is the largest nationwide
              network of public safety agencies, critical infrastructure,
              schools and private enterprise security. The IRAPP is
              transport agnostic, device agnostic and media agnostic. It
              leverages your current communications assets and
              incorporates new devices as needed. Connect to the IRAPP
              network via public or private LTE, satellite or terrestrial
              broadband.</p>
            <p>Emergencies are unpredictable; the who, what, when and
              where of communications needed for mitigation is unknown
              until the incident unfolds. Additionally, emergency
              environments are not static events; new primary as well as
              secondary and tertiary effects can rapidly emerge.
              Therefore, collaboration is needed with those in both remote
              and immediate proximity. The complex inter-dependencies of
              the real world require a communications approach that serves
              this dynamic.</p>
