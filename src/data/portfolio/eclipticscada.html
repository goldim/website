<p>Ecliptic SCADA is a control system architecture comprising computers, networked data communications and graphical
    user interfaces for high-level supervision of machines and processes. It also covers sensors and other devices, such
    as programmable logic controllers, which interface with process plant or machinery.</p>
<p>Client-server communication is implemented with node-opcua library.
    Transport layer of node-opcua is websockets for web browser clients and tcp for Electron version of application.</p>
<p>Ecliptic SCADA's frontend is based on Qooxdoo, its backend uses the C++/C OPC UA implementation.</p>
<p>One of adaptations for the system is a tram traction substations' system for whole city. On the screenshots you may see the following.
    <ul>
        <li>Real-time dinamic electric schema which shows a current state of traction substation</li>
        <li>Table of events and alarms which happen on the substation</li>
        <li>Map of all substations</li>
    </ul>
