<p>Ecliptic SCADA is a control system architecture comprising computers, networked data communications and graphical
    user interfaces for high-level supervision of machines and processes. It also covers sensors and other devices, such
    as programmable logic controllers, which interface with process plant or machinery.</p>
<p>Client-server communication is implemented via node-opcua library.
    Transport layer of node-opcua is websockets for web browser clients and tcp for Electron application.</p>
<p>Ecliptic SCADA's frontend is based on Qooxdoo, its backend uses the C++/C OPC UA implementation.</p>
