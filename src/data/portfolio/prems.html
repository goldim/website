            <p>
              This app is a <a href="https://www.qooxdoo.org/"
                               rel="nofollow">qooxdoo</a> based front-end
              for a postgresql database with python jsonrpc web services
              (ELVIS, see sources) aimed to manage biological resources
              for plants and seeds. It is actively developed by the <a
                href="https://www6.angers-nantes.inra.fr/irhs/Recherche/Bioinformatics-for-plant-Defense-Investigations"
                rel="nofollow">BIDefI</a> team at <a
                href="https://www6.angers-nantes.inra.fr/irhs"
                rel="nofollow">IRHS</a>. In the app, users can define
              groups or collections of plants and use them in projects and
              experiments. They can characterize them and will be able to
              store manipulation done in laboratory like sampling or
              extracting DNA. It is like a LIMS but focused on plants and
              samples management.<br>
              The instance of the app is for internal use only but the app
              is released under <a href="https://cecill.info/"
