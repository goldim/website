<h1>About Qooxdoo</h1>

<p>Qooxdoo (pronounced ['kuksdu:]) is a universal JavaScript framework
for creating enterprise-grade single-page web applications. With its
class-based object orientation, Qooxdoo allows the code of even the
most complex applications well organized and manageable. The integrated
compiler produces single file applications ready for deployment.</p>

<h2 id="framework"><a class="anchor" data-id="framework"
href="documentation/#/about?id=framework"><span>Framework</span></a> </h2>

<p>The Qooxdoo framework enhances the javascript language with a full-fledged,
class-based object-oriented system, including a powerful properties
system, interfaces, and mixins. Qooxdoo code is based on namespaces to
allow rigorous and scalable code structure, asy integration with other
libraries and existing user code. It comes with a <a href="/apps/apiviewer"
target="_blank">comprehensive API reference</a> that is auto-generated from
Javadoc-like comments in the framework sourcecode.</p>

<p>Qooxdoo programs are written in plain javascript; no new syntax is
introduced, and all the extra functionality is realized through clever
application of existing javascript abilities. In order to create an
application that can be loaded by the browser, the Qooxdoo source code
has to be processed by the Qooxdoo compiler.</p><p>The Qooxdoo compiler
is a NodeJS-based application written in Qooxdoo itself. It loads
Qooxdoo source code and adds all the required framework components
necessary to create an application that is executable in the browser.</p>

<h2 id="gui-toolkit"><a class="anchor" data-id="gui-toolkit"
href="documentation/#/about?id=gui-toolkit"><span>GUI Toolkit</span></a> </h2>

<p> Despite being a pure JavaScript framework, Qooxdoo is on par with GUI
toolkits for desktop applications like Qt when it comes to advanced, yet easy
to implement, user interfaces. It offers a full-blown set of widgets that
are hardly distinguishable from elements of native desktop applications.
Full built-in support for keyboard navigation, focus, tab handling, and drag
&amp; drop is provided. Dimensions can be specified as static, auto-sizing,
stretching, percentage, weighted flex or min/max, or even as combinations
of those. All widgets are based on powerful and flexible layout managers
which are at the core of many of the advanced layout capabilities.</p>

<p>No HTML or CSS has to be used and augmented to define the interface.
The Qooxdoo developer does not even have to know CSS to style the
interface. Clean and easy-to-configure themes for appearance, colors,
borders, fonts and icons allow for complete themability.</p>

<h2 id="communication"><a class="anchor" data-id="communication"
href="documentation/#/about?id=communication"><span>Communication</span></a>
</h2>

<p>While being a client-side and server-agnostic solution, the Qooxdoo
project includes different communication facilities, and supports low-level
XMLHttpRequests (XHR) as well as an RPC API. An abstract transport
layer supports queues, timeouts and implementations via XHR, Iframes
and Scripts. Like the rest of Qooxdoo, it fully supports event-based
programming which greatly simplifies asynchronous communication.</p>

<h2 id="development-tools"><a class="anchor" data-id="development-tools"
href="documentation/#/about?id=development-tools"><span>Development
tools</span></a></h2>

<p>Qooxdoo is not only a library, but also comes
with a set of sophisticated tools. Some help with the development workflow,
such as the <a href="documentation/#/development/cli/commands">command
line interface</a>. Others let you quickly get to know the widgets (such
as the <a href="/apps/widgetbrowser" target="_blank">widget browser</a>),
become fluent in the Qooxdoo API (such as the <a href="/apps/apiviewer"
target="_blank">API Viewer</a>), or to debug or demonstrate code snippets
(such as the <a href="/apps/playground" target="_blank">"Playground"</a>).
</p>

<h2 id="package-system"><a class="anchor" data-id="package-system"
href="documentation/#/about?id=package-system"><span>Package
system</span></a> </h2>

<p>A versatile web framework wouldn't be complete without a package
system which allows modularizing and reusing code. Qooxdoo's
<a href="documentation/#/development/cli/packages">package
system</a> is based on GitHub repos. Packages can be
installed and published very easily with the Qooxdoo CLI.</p>


<h2 id="history"> <a class="anchor" data-id="history"
href="documentation/#/about?id=history"><span>History</span></a></h2>

<p> Qooxdoo was originally developed by one of the world's leading
web hosters: 1&amp;1 Internet (now part of United Internet AG). In
late 2015, the Qooxdoo framework with all its assets, was turned
over to the Qooxdoo association, located in Switzerland. Qooxdoo
development has, since then, been lead by a group of dedicated
developers congregating on <a href="https://gitter.im/qooxdoo/qooxdoo"
target="_blank">gitter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo"
target="_blank">github</a> . Contributions are always
welcome.</p>
