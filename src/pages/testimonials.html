  <dd>In late 2014, we searched and evaluated many Javascript UI
  frameworks in order to find the best suited for veteran C#
  programmers who are dependent on Visual Studio IDE. We finally
  decided to use Qooxdoo UI framework since it is easy to learn for
  developers who prefer to write their UI through code than using HTML
  markup and the hierarchy of classes in Qooxdoo is similar to C#
  built-in framework class library. Choosing Qooxdoo was the best
  decision we ever made! Though qooxdoo has been around for many
  years, its design and methodology are now earning more popularity
  these days just like SwiftUI, Flutter, Kotlin UI DSL and C# Markup
  for Xamarin. Qooxdoo really shines when developing and maintaining
  large and complex browser-based systems, especially when used with
    the TypeScript language (https://github.com/jbaron/qx-typed).</dd>
